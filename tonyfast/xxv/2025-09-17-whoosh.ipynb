Many individuals struggle with keyboard use due to strength loss or difficulty in precisely pressing individual keys, which can lead to accidental key presses. In environments where workstations are shared by multiple users, this modular solution offers a flexible alternative to commercial, permanently installed assistive devices that are often seen as too noticeable or inappropriate.</p>\n",
       "<p>This unremarkable yet effective cover is specifically designed for the &quot;geemarc&quot; keyboard (<a href=\"https://geemarc.com/uk/product/standard-keyboard-white/\">https://geemarc.com/uk/product/standard-keyboard-white/</a>), known for its clear key layout. It helps improve ease of use by minimizing accidental key presses for both people with motor and/or visual disabilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>We invite you to download and use this design to make everyday tasks a little easier for people with disabilities.</p>\n",

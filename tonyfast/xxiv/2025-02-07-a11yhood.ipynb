We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

I wanted it in different weights of yarn, but the exact same pattern.  I wanted to be able to use either a 3 weight yarn or a worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted to use solids and the lovely Mandela/Self-striping yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted the length to be adjustable, to let the knitter decide whether or not to make the pattern longer.  The pattern does make the length shown, but just keep doing the last repeat to make it longer if you prefer.\r\n\r\nI wanted something the elderly could wear in a wheelchair and not be concerned about it catching in the wheels.  It can also be work by nursing mothers for \"modesty\" reasons.  It would also be lovely for young girls.  And yes, that is all in this one pattern.  Just choose the yarn you want to use and appropriate needle to go with it.\r\n\r\nThis may also be made with a crew neck instead of the rolled ribbed neck.  Many possibilities.\r\n\r\nPlus it is an easy pattern to memorize!  \r\n\r\nThank you for choosing my pattern.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4a194_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wheelchair-sweater</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4a194_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >I designed this sweater to meet the needs of someone in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nIt is my experience that a shawl doesn't stay in place or it catches in the wheels. A blanket doesn't warm the upper body and a sweater bunches uncomfortably at the back of the chair. Someone with limited mobility can't adjust for comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis design has a shortened back for warmth but not bulk. It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4a194_level0_row4\" class=\"row_heading level0 row4\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4a194_row4_col0\" class=\"data row4 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4a194_level0_row5\" class=\"row_heading level0 row5\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4a194_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries.

RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar. Follow the installation instructions. Once installed the app will be in your App drawer under RoboTour.

This is a fabulous piece of kit. I have a metal screw in the mastoid bone in my head (which incidently has to be tightened each year so I do occasionally have a screw loose),and my heading aid clips onto this screw. I hear through the bone rather than through my broken ear. This does, however, make it a little difficult wearing hats, as the hearing aid sits proud of my head and anything placed on top of it makes it whistle like a tea kettle on the boil! Lyra Hat is my solution so I'm sharing it here for other people like me. It would also be useful if you wear a ponytail.\r\n\r\nSkills required. This hat is worked in the round from the top down.

Thanks to a genius plastic surgeon and eleven surgeries, my father’s nose was rebuilt and looks just as good as ever. However, because of all these surgeries, blood flow to the tip of his nose has been severely compromised, and because of this, it gets very cold, very quickly. Living in New England has not helped the situation, and the chilly winters are bitter and often turn his nose white with cold. He has tried scarves, facemasks and everything in between, but they often end up fogging up his glasses instead of warming his nose. I have tried many patterns and have finally succeeded in a “nose cozy” that my dad is ecstatic about, and allows him to shovel the snow, play with the dog, and get the mail without his nose freezing or fogging up his glasses. He can still wear a hat for extra ear warmth, although this does cover the ears, and a scarf for his chin, and it is perfect for the winter weather!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pattern is fairly easy and super quick!

We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_bb8c1_level0_row6\" class=\"row_heading level0 row6\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_bb8c1_row6_col0\" class=\"data row6 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_bb8c1_level0_row7\" class=\"row_heading level0 row7\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_bb8c1_row7_col0\" class=\"data row7 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries. The system comprises an autonomous robotic guide, a purpose-built Android application, and a web server mediating the communication between the two. Up to two Android devices can control RoboTour and followed by many more. The app allows users to interact with RoboTour intuitively in multiple languages. RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support.

Unlike other ASR libraries including Facebook's wav2letter++ Julius is fully supported on Windows and unlike Mozilla's own DeepSpeech, Julis can decode speech waveform input via a system mic device in real-time with appropriate handling of silences and pauses. Julius is used in the [Simon](https://simon.kde.org/) voice control program for KDE. Leslaw Pawlaczyk has [created](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/julius-speech-models-based-on-mozilla-corpus/27651) Julius models based on the Mozilla corpus and has modified Julius to support DNN-HMM models as well as GMM-HMM. \n\nJulius can be built as a statically-linked binary and run as a sub-process of Victor. Victor communicates with Julius by monitoring its stdout stream and detecting the different states the program is in:\n\n[![Victor Debug Mode](https://tt4r9w.dm.files.1drv.com/y4m2-x2RJFkx1VaXFHLqEWIUwZhBfEbfKaTlKsCQxKlnboznLObf-BnmLosDEg5Gj7qWA8JIj9wA2wjxVwJsqD4H1agM-WaIF7AfcgLOrnL43DZJ5B9r_KRe-og-njzg2a6SeOdZYGdaKA8INf67y7suXXkeUwWyxkdsnp2eEMlt-Ve-6JJmiMvoG_l3JPe6paKY6U-eNK8rTcItqLKaZ_VoQ?width=475&height=315&cropmode=none)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PFBRR15F-A \"Victor Debug Mode\")\n\nThe desired Julius configuration is specified in a plain text file and passed to the Julius executable as a startup argument. In this way Julius can be used by any program on any hardware or operation system platform supported by Julius. Julius's portability and real-time input recognition capabilities make it a good choice for the ASR component of an integrated voice stack.\n\n### SnipsNLU (NLU)\n[Snips NLU](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu-rs) is a hi-speed accurate open-source NLU inference engine which can recognize intents and entities in utterances for a particular domain in real-time. It is written in Rust and has an FFI allowing it to be used by any language that call C libraries. \nVictor [interfaces](https://github.com/allisterb/Victor/blob/master/src/NLU/Victor.NLU.Snips/SnipsApi.cs) with the Snips NLU engine using its C FFI e.g in C# calling a SnipsNLU function in a native DLL looks like:\n```\n[DllImport(\"snips_nlu_ffi\", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]\n        internal static extern SNIPS_RESULT snips_nlu_engine_create_from_dir\n            ([In, MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string root_dir, [In, Out] ref IntPtr client);\n```\nAbstractions over the lower-level Snips functions are built-up to avoid other code having to manage the details of calling the library code. This is the standard procedure used for Snips bindings to other languages like Python. This ability to interface with the Snips library directly removes the need for an intermediate Python interpreter or REST API makes SnipsNLU a good choice for the NLU component of an integrated voice stack.\n\n### Mimic (TTS)\nVictor can use the Mimic TTS engine but generally it is better to rely on the operating system's narrator or TTS capabilities or the user's installed screen reader.\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n"

I hear through the bone rather than through my broken ear. This does, however, make it a little difficult wearing hats, as the hearing aid sits proud of my head and anything placed on top of it makes it whistle like a tea kettle on the boil! Lyra Hat is my solution so I'm sharing it here for other people like me. It would also be useful if you wear a ponytail.\r\n\r\nSkills required. This hat is worked in the round from the top down.

Casting on and off within the work.\r\n\r\nTension: 14st x 15 rows in pattern over 10cm x 10cm worked in the round. I used 6.5mm double pointed needles for the top and 6.5mm x 40cm circular needle for the main body of the hat.

Thanks to a genius plastic surgeon and eleven surgeries, my father’s nose was rebuilt and looks just as good as ever. However, because of all these surgeries, blood flow to the tip of his nose has been severely compromised, and because of this, it gets very cold, very quickly. Living in New England has not helped the situation, and the chilly winters are bitter and often turn his nose white with cold. He has tried scarves, facemasks and everything in between, but they often end up fogging up his glasses instead of warming his nose. I have tried many patterns and have finally succeeded in a “nose cozy” that my dad is ecstatic about, and allows him to shovel the snow, play with the dog, and get the mail without his nose freezing or fogging up his glasses. He can still wear a hat for extra ear warmth, although this does cover the ears, and a scarf for his chin, and it is perfect for the winter weather!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pattern is fairly easy and super quick!

We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

A blanket doesn't warm the upper body and a sweater bunches uncomfortably at the back of the chair. Someone with limited mobility can't adjust for comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis design has a shortened back for warmth but not bulk. It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_c8f1e_level0_row4\" class=\"row_heading level0 row4\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_c8f1e_row4_col0\" class=\"data row4 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_c8f1e_level0_row5\" class=\"row_heading level0 row5\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_c8f1e_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries.

Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar. Follow the installation instructions. Once installed the app will be in your App drawer under RoboTour. Tap the app to open it. \n\n\n## Group Members\n\n* **[Mahbub Iftekhar](https://www.mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/)** - *Team Manager & Android Developer*\n* **[David Speers](https://github.com/davidspeers)** - *Android Developer & UI Designer* \n* **[Michal Dauenhauer](https://github.com/michuszkud)** - *Embedded Developer & Custom Sensor Guru*\n* **[Alice Wu](https://github.com/AliceWoooo)** -  *Robotics Software Developer*\n* **[Devidas Lavrik](https://github.com/DLavrik)** - *Lego Builder & PID Expert* \n* **[Finn Zhan Chen](http://finnzhanchen.com/)** - *Business Analyst*\n* **[Mariyana Cholakova](https://github.com/chMariyana)** - *Designer & Admin* \n\n## Contact us\nYou are welcome to visit out [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RoboTour/) or send us an e-mail on robotour.sdp@gmail.com \n\n\n## References\n\n* GitHub.

A blanket doesn't warm the upper body and a sweater bunches uncomfortably at the back of the chair. Someone with limited mobility can't adjust for comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis design has a shortened back for warmth but not bulk. It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_04be1_level0_row1\" class=\"row_heading level0 row1\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_04be1_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_04be1_level0_row2\" class=\"row_heading level0 row2\" >https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR</th>\n      <td id=\"T_04be1_row2_col0\" class=\"data row2 col0\" ># DReyeVR\n### Welcome to DReyeVR, a VR driving simulator for behavioural and interactions research.\n\n[![Main Figure](Docs/Figures/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGIPSDOMGpY)\n\n[Submission Video Demonstration (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGIPSDOMGpY)\n<!-- Welcome to the DReyeVR wiki! -->\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n\nThis project extends the [`Carla`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/0.9.13) simulator to add virtual reality integration, a first-person maneuverable ego-vehicle, eye tracking support, and several immersion enhancements.\n\nIf you have questions, hopefully our [F.A.Q. wiki page](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) and [issues page](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) can answer some of them.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Currently DReyeVR only supports Carla versions: [0.9.13](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/0.9.13) with Unreal Engine 4.26\n\n## Highlights\n### Ego Vehicle\nFully drivable **virtual reality (VR) ego-vehicle** with [SteamVR integration](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unreal_plugin/tree/4.23) (see [EgoVehicle.h](DReyeVR/EgoVehicle.h))\n- SteamVR HMD head tracking (orientation & position)\n  - We have tested with the following devices:\n    | Device | VR Supported | Eye tracking | OS |\n    | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n    | [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://business.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Windows, Linux |\n    | [Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/) | :white_check_mark: | :x: | Windows |\n  - While we haven't tested other headsets, they should still work for basic VR usage (not eye tracking) if supported by SteamVR.\n  - Eye tracking is currently **ONLY** supported on the HTC Vive Pro Eye since we use [SRanipal](https://forum.htc.com/topic/5641-sranipal-faq/) for the eye-tracker SDK. We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

The pattern does make the length shown, but just keep doing the last repeat to make it longer if you prefer.\r\n\r\nI wanted something the elderly could wear in a wheelchair and not be concerned about it catching in the wheels.  It can also be work by nursing mothers for \"modesty\" reasons.  It would also be lovely for young girls.  And yes, that is all in this one pattern.  Just choose the yarn you want to use and appropriate needle to go with it.\r\n\r\nThis may also be made with a crew neck instead of the rolled ribbed neck.  Many possibilities.\r\n\r\nPlus it is an easy pattern to memorize!  \r\n\r\nThank you for choosing my pattern.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_04be1_level0_row5\" class=\"row_heading level0 row5\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_04be1_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries. The system comprises an autonomous robotic guide, a purpose-built Android application, and a web server mediating the communication between the two. Up to two Android devices can control RoboTour and followed by many more. The app allows users to interact with RoboTour intuitively in multiple languages. RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar.

As a USB Mouse, the joystick controls cursor movement and the assistive switches activate the left mouse button, right mouse button, middle mouse button, and scroll. As a USB Mouse, the joystick maps to the joystick/thumbstick and the assistive switches map to the joystick buttons. An additional assistive switch can be attached to the Hub to cycle between three setting slots and change the output mode between USB Mouse mode and USB Gamepad mode.\n\nThe device is comprised of a custom printed circuit board, off-the-shelf electronics, and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials for a single build is about $100. The individual unit cost cost is closer to $55. \n\nThe Forest Hub is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.\n\nLast updated: 2024-Apr-17\nThe latest version (V2.1) includes a new easier to use LED jig, updated firmware with center calibration, and updated documentation.\nAn updated version of the PCB and enclosure has been released (V2.0.1, 2024-Feb-20). The last version of the Forest Hub (v2.0.1) has been built and tested.\n\n<img src=\"Photos/Forest_Hub.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"A Forest Hub in a red enclosure.\">\n\n\nMMC Assistive Device Library Listing: https://makersmakingchange.com/s/product/forest-joystick-mouse-hub/01tJR000000E4bdYAC\n\n## OpenAT Joysticks\nThis design is part of the [OpenAT Joystick Project](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks), a collection of open source designs for digital access and adapted gaming.  \n\n## How to Obtain the Device\n### 1.

We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

I wanted it in different weights of yarn, but the exact same pattern.  I wanted to be able to use either a 3 weight yarn or a worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted to use solids and the lovely Mandela/Self-striping yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted the length to be adjustable, to let the knitter decide whether or not to make the pattern longer.  The pattern does make the length shown, but just keep doing the last repeat to make it longer if you prefer.\r\n\r\nI wanted something the elderly could wear in a wheelchair and not be concerned about it catching in the wheels.  It can also be work by nursing mothers for \"modesty\" reasons.  It would also be lovely for young girls.  And yes, that is all in this one pattern.  Just choose the yarn you want to use and appropriate needle to go with it.\r\n\r\nThis may also be made with a crew neck instead of the rolled ribbed neck.  Many possibilities.\r\n\r\nPlus it is an easy pattern to memorize!  \r\n\r\nThank you for choosing my pattern.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4281b_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wheelchair-sweater</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4281b_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >I designed this sweater to meet the needs of someone in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nIt is my experience that a shawl doesn't stay in place or it catches in the wheels. A blanket doesn't warm the upper body and a sweater bunches uncomfortably at the back of the chair. Someone with limited mobility can't adjust for comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis design has a shortened back for warmth but not bulk. It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4281b_level0_row4\" class=\"row_heading level0 row4\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4281b_row4_col0\" class=\"data row4 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_4281b_level0_row5\" class=\"row_heading level0 row5\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_4281b_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries. The system comprises an autonomous robotic guide, a purpose-built Android application, and a web server mediating the communication between the two. Up to two Android devices can control RoboTour and followed by many more. The app allows users to interact with RoboTour intuitively in multiple languages. RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar.

This can be helpful for people who want to create \nuser interactions with the press of a button - and it allows people who can't use standard computer input devices\nto play games, surf the internet, communicate and much more.\n\n![A FABI box with attached 3d-printed switch](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/img/FABI4.png \"FABI box with attached switch\")\n\n\n## How?\n\nThe FABI Interface can be actuated via dedicated buttons, momentary switches or self-made\nelectrical contacts. Additionally, a sip-puff sensor can be used to create user input.\nFABI consists of a hardware module (a low-cost microcontroller which behaves\nas a computer mouse and/or keyboard) and a config manager software for configuration of\nthe desired functions. The FABI system can be attached to computers, tablets or smart phones via USB.\nAdditionally, a bluetooth-module is available for devices that do not have a USB port (some Android or iOS phones).\n\n## Folder structure of this repository\nEssential information can be found in the following folders\n* _Case Designs:_ different 3d-printable / lasercut designs for enclosures\n* _Documentation:_ all user and construction manuals\n* _FabiGUI_C#:_ the (outdated) graphical user interface (for Windows)\n* _FabiWare:_ the microcontroller firmware\n* _hardware:_ the KiCad design files and models for schematics and PCB layout\n* _Settings:_ demo configurations which can be loaded into the FABI device via the GUI\n\nThe source of the current web based config manager can be found in another repository: [source of web based config manager](https://github.com/asterics/Addon-Bluetooth-WebGUI/tree/main/webgui)\n\n## Configuration Manager and User manual\n\nThe FABI system does not ony offer fixed mappings of buttons to functions - it allows storing multiple configuration settings and changing them \"on-the-fly\". For configuration the [web-based config manager](https://fabi.asterics.eu/) should be used.\nYou can find information how to configure the individual button functions and system options in the user manual:\n\n* [English user manual for configuration manager](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual/Markdown/Fabi%20User%20Manual.md) \n* [German user manual for configuration manager](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual/Markdown/Fabi%20Anwendungsanleitung.md)\n\n\n\n## Building the hardware\n\nThere are various options for building FABI-compatible switch interfaces: you can order parts and build our construction kit, or make a completely self-driven version.\nThe most affordable version consists of just a microcontroller and attached momentary switches (material cost: a few bucks ...). The construction kit offers a PCB, LC-Display, \nNeopixel color led for indication of active configuration and optional modules (pressure sensor for sip/puff use, Bluetooth module for wireless access to phones/tablets etc.)\nFollowing documentation is available for these different approaches:\n* **Construction kit / PCB Version**: for building the FABI PCB Version from the construction kit.\\\nSee [Construction kit building guide](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/PCB-Version/FABIManual.pdf)\n* **DIY Building Guide - \"intermediate\"**: guide for creating a FABI device with a bare microcontroller and the provided 3d-printed enclosures.\\\nSee [English version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/en/FABI_ConstructionManual.pdf) \nor [German version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/de/FABI_Bauanleitung.pdf)\n* **DIY Building Guide - \"all-selfmade\"**: guide for creating a FABI device with a bare microcontroller and without the provided 3d-printed enclosures.\\\nSee [DIY Building Guide](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/SelfmadeBox/FABI_Construction_SelfmadeBox.pdf)\n\n## Building and Installing the Firmware\n\nThe FABI system consists of a firmware part which runs on the [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) microcontroller. The firmware can be updated / uploaded directly from the [Configuration Manager](https://fabi.asterics.eu/). Alternatively, you can build and upload the fimware using a recent version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).\nBesides the Arduino framework, the following libraries are used und must be installed before the firmware can be compiled:\n\n* [Light_WS2812 Neopixel library by cpldcpu](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812) \n* [SSD1306 Oled/LCD library by Lekus2k](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306) (used version: 1.8.2)\n\nPlease follow the installation instructions in the respective github repositories.\n\n\n## Bluetooth AddOn\n\nFABI supports the connection of an optional [Bluetooth Module](https://github.com/asterics/esp32_mouse_keyboard). The easiest way to use this module is to build the construction kit, \nbecause the PCB offers a dedicated 10-pin connector which fits the module. Pairing process and firmware update for the BT-module will be described in the user manual soon!\n\n![FABI PCB version, equipped with Bluetooth Module](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/img/pcb_open.JPG \"FABI PCB version with equipped bluetooth module\")\n\n\n## Example setups and applications\n\n![An opened FABI box, where you can see the Teensy microcontroller board and the 6 jackplugs](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/img/7.jpg \"FABI box with jackplugs\")\n![A wooden piece with 6 buttons, arranged between, left and right of your hands. Enabling faster working with shortcuts on each button](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/img/2.jpg \"RapidCoding prototype, powered by FABI\")\n![A FABI box, where 3 different external

Recommendation\nIf you don't have any experience with a voice to code system I strongly recommend you try out other projects first. While this project is definitely usable it is still mostly an experiment in using multiple small vocabulary speech decoders instead of a more verbose grammar. The idea is that with a smaller vocabulary you get a boost in recognition accuracy and the parsers can use less verbose commands. This comes at the cost of having to manually manage which mode is active. In addition, as modifications are made to the grammar for a parser, the decoder will have to be rebuilt in order for kaldi to recognize the new words. There are scripts to ease this process but it may be helpful to learn a bit about [language models](https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutoriallm/#language-models) if for no other reason than to understand the basic terminology used in the script comments.\n\n## Requirements\n- Xorg and xdotool (if you're using wayland you may be able to swap in [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool))\n- Gnome, the transcripts are displayed via a gnome extension. The notify middleware simply uses the 'gdbus' command to communicate with the extension so this could be swapped out for another display method. \n- Vim compiled with [channel](https://vimhelp.org/channel.txt.html) support\n- [sopare](https://github.com/bishoph/sopare) for sound recognition\n- docker for installing the server\n- Kaldi uses about 1-2gb of ram when in use, building your own model uses around 10gb of ram\n\nNote that you can disable the sopare and vim code by not including them in the message pipeline,\n\n```\n   #silviux/main.py\n   handler = Handler()\n   handler.use(Notify(context))\n   handler.use(Sleep(context))    \n   handler.use(Mode(context))         \n   handler.use(Hold(context))  \n   #handler.use(Sopare(context))\n   #handler.use(Vim(context))    \n   handler.use(History(context))\n   handler.use(Kaldi(context))\n   handler.use(Parse(context))\n   handler.use(Optimistic(context))\n   handler.use(Execute(context))\n   handler.init()\n```\nThe notify middleware is required but you may simply comment out the part of the notify code that invokes os.command if you're trying to run the program without gnome.\n\nThe client code is now python3 and depends on the PyAudio and ws4py packages.\n\n## Setup\n\nSee the README in server/silviux-server for the server installation using docker. The client will connect to either the silvius server or the [kaldi gstreamer server](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server) but only the silviux-server supports changing the decoder.\n\nThe server's silviux.yaml file contains the paths to the kaldi decoders. You will either need to create these yourself or download the ones I have prepared at [https://silviux.weisman.dev](https://silviux.weisman.dev/). The model creation scripts place the created models into the server/models directory. The servers yaml file expects the models to be at server/silviux-server/models, so this directory is a symlink to the models directory above it.\n\nThe program uses [sopare](https://github.com/bishoph/sopare) for switching between modes. Install this program and train it on the sounds found in the middleware/sopare.py file. Place the sopare_plugin directory into the plugins directory of sopare.\n\nSee silviux/config/silviux.yaml for configuring which port the server is listening on, where the sopare program is installed, which microphone to use etc. The main program will still accept the same command line args as silvius (see silviux/stream.py) to override the options in the yaml file.\n\n```\n$ python3 test.py\n$ python3 main.py\n```\n\n## Project Overview\n\n- ezmouse/ This is a standalone program that displays an overlay for controlling the mouse. It is invoked by a custom command\n- gnome-extension/ The gnome extension for displaying transcripts (install by copying into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and enable from https://extensions.gnome.org/local/)\n- lm_utils/ Scripts for creating language models and lexicons\n- server/ This directory should be mounted by the docker container, contains kaldi models and server code\n- silviux/ The client code\n- silviux/config/ The word to keysym mappings and vocabulary used by the parsers, silviux.yaml contains the microphone, stream and sopare config\n- silviux/config/custom_commands.py The vim, ezmouse and some example custom commands\n- silviux/middleware/ How the program's state is updated in response to incoming messages (see silviux/test/test_middleware.py)\n- silviux/parser/ The parser manager instantiates the parsers in this directory and tracks which is currently active\n- sopare_plugin/ This should be placed into the sopare projects plugin directory\n- vim_server/ Code for opening a gnome-terminal running vim and connecting using a vim channel (tcp)\n\n\n## Creating Decoders\n\nThe contents of the lm_utils/ directory are not imported or used at all during the normal (main.py) execution of the client code. It contains scripts for creating the needed language model and lexicon files for creating a kaldi decoder. For the 'programming' language model, the goal is to create a corpus of text that is the spoken equivalent of some original code.\n\n```\n#somefile.js\nfunction() {\n  return \"hello\";\n}\n```\nWe wish to map the above text into the spoken words we would say to produce that text.\n```\n#key config\n{\"space\": \"spay\", \"(\": \"brace\", \")\": \"mace, \"enter\": \"spike\", \";\": \"sem\"}\n```\n\n```\n#somefile.js.modified\nfunction sue shi spay brace spike\nreturn spay quote hello quote sem spike\nmace spike\n```\nWe can then train a language model on these files to help improve recognition accuracy. The workflow is something like this:\n\n- lm_utils/dlrepos.py this downloads projects from github into lm_utils/repos/\n- lm_utils/filewalker.py this maps the files to our language and concats them into a single file (read the comments and code in this file before running it)\n- lm_utils/scripts/makelm.sh Use the commands in this file to create the language model and lexicon (read the comments in this file)\n- You now have a language model and a lexicon, name them mymodel.lm and mylexicon.txt and place them in the server/ directory which should be mounted by the kaldi server docker volume\n- If you haven't yet, read the README in the server dir and the comments in server/silviux-server/lm-script/silviux-mkgraph.sh (the lm-script/silviux.sh script must be run first to download the aspire model and copy some scripts into place within the kaldi installation)\n- Within the container run $ /silviux/silviux-server/lm-script/silviux-mkgraph.sh mynewmodel\n- This script should create the model and copy it into the server/models dir\n- Add a 'mynewmodel' entry to the server's yaml config (copy paste another models config and search replace with 'mynewmodel')\n- You should now be able to send a {\"change_decoder\": \"mynewmodel\"} message to the kaldi server and test the new decoder\n\nNote that when you first use a new decoder, it takes about a minute for kaldi to set the adaption state. This means your first impression will often be that it isn't working well and you may try changing the volume or tone of your voice to \"help\" it with the recognition. Try not to do this and just speak naturally for the first minute or so before making a determination.\n\n## Language Model Example\n\nYou should read the comments in the lm_utils/scripts/makelm.sh file. This file is a collection of commands used in the creation of language models and the formatting of lexicon files so they will work with kaldi. As an example, here I will walk through the commands for creating a new 'command' decoder which will be a mix of the english model downloaded from the kaldi website and the terminal words from our 'command' grammar.\n\nFirst you will need the lm and lexicon from the [aspire chain model](https://kaldi-asr.org/models/m1). If you ran the server's silviux.sh install script you already have these files within the docker container's /opt/kaldi/egs/aspire/s5/ directory. The LM can be found in data/local/lm/4gram-mincount/lm_unpruned.gz. Extract the 'lm_unpruned' file into the lm_utils/exp/ directory. The lexicon file can be found at data/local/dict/lexicon2_raw.txt, also copy this to the lm_utils/exp directory.\n\nNow we need to create a small language model from our command grammar to mix with the english lm and lexicon. We're going to run a script for outputting the terminals from our grammar and use it to create a lexicon and a bigram corpus to create a language model.\n\n```\n# From the silviux project root\n$ python3 parser_utils.py command > lm_utils/exp/terminals\n$ python3 lm_utils/ngrams.py lm_utils/exp/terminals > lm_utils/exp/bigrams\n$ ngram-count -wbdiscount -text lm_utils/exp/bigrams -lm lm_utils/exp/command.lm\n\n```\nWe now have a language model for our terminal words at lm_utils/exp/command.lm. We're also going to need a lexicon for these terminal words. Upload the lm_utils/exp/terminals file to http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lextool.html (use the 'word file' option then hit 'compile). Save the .dict file to lm_utils/exp/command.dict. We're now going to format this file and combine it with the english lexicon and finish off by removing any duplicate lines (kaldi won't compile our decoder with duplicates).\n\n```\n$ cd lm_utils\n$ python3 lexicon-format.py exp/command.dict exp/terminals exp/commandlexicon.txt\n$ cat exp/commandlexicon.txt exp/lexicon2_raw.txt > exp/merged.txt\n$ sort exp/merged.txt | uniq > exp/mylexicon.txt\n```\nWe now have the lexicon file, exp/mylexicon.txt, which we will use with the decoder creation script. The final step is to mix our command bigram language model with the english language model. \n\n```\nngram -lm exp/lm_unpruned -mix-lm exp/command.lm -lambda 0.2 -write-lm exp/mymodel.lm\n```\nThe exp/mylexicon.txt and exp/mymodel.lm files can now be placed into server/ (or whatever directory the docker container is mounted to) for running the decoder creation scripts.\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_ac3b8_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >https://github.com/grwgreg/silviux</th>\n      <td id=\"T_ac3b8_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >voice to code on linux with kaldi</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n"

We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact. See [DReyeVRUtils.h](DReyeVR/DReyeVRUtils.h).\n- World ambient audio\n  - Birdsong, wind, smoke, etc. (See [Docs/Sounds.md](Docs/Sounds.md))\n- Non-ego-centric audio (Engine revving from non-ego vehicles)\n- Synchronized Replay with per-frame frame capture for post-hoc analysis (See [Docs/Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md))\n- Recorder/replayer media functions\n  - Added in-game keyboard commands Play/Pause/Forward/Backward/etc.\n- Static in-environment directional signs for natural navigation (See [`Docs/Signs.md`](Docs/Signs.md))\n- Adding weather to the Carla recorder/replayer/query (See this [Carla PR](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/5235))\n- Custom dynamic 3D actors with full recording support (eg. HUD indicators for direction, AR bounding boxes, visual targets, etc.). See [CustomActor.md](Docs/CustomActor.md) for more.\n- (DEBUG ONLY) Foveated rendering for improved performance with gaze-aware (or fixed) variable rate shading\n\n## Install/Build\nSee [`Docs/Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to:\n- Install and build `DReyeVR` on top of a working `Carla` repository. \n- Download plugins for `DReyeVR` required for fancy features such as:\n  - Eye tracking (SRanipal)\n  - Steering wheel/pedals (Logitech)\n- Set up a `conda` environment for DReyeVR PythonAPI\n\n## OS compatibility\n| OS | VR | Eye tracking | Audio | Keyboard+Mouse | Racing wheel | Foveated Rendering (Editor) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Linux | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n| MacOS | :x: | :x: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |\n- While Windows (10) is recommended for optimized VR support, all our work translates to Linux systems except for the eye tracking and hardware integration which have Windows-only dependencies.\n  - Unfortunately the eye-tracking firmware is proprietary & does not work on Linux\n    - This is (currently) only supported on Windows because of some proprietary dependencies between [HTC SRanipal SDK](https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-sranipal-sdk/) and Tobii's SDK. Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_bb37e_level0_row8\" class=\"row_heading level0 row8\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wrapped-in-lace-picc-line-cover</th>\n      <td id=\"T_bb37e_row8_col0\" class=\"data row8 col0\" >One of the reasons I started designing was because I wanted to provide more beautiful patterns to those who craft for good causes.

The system comprises an autonomous robotic guide, a purpose-built Android application, and a web server mediating the communication between the two. Up to two Android devices can control RoboTour and followed by many more. The app allows users to interact with RoboTour intuitively in multiple languages. RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar. Follow the installation instructions. Once installed the app will be in your App drawer under RoboTour. Tap the app to open it. \n\n\n## Group Members\n\n* **[Mahbub Iftekhar](https://www.mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/)** - *Team Manager & Android Developer*\n* **[David Speers](https://github.com/davidspeers)** - *Android Developer & UI Designer* \n* **[Michal Dauenhauer](https://github.com/michuszkud)** - *Embedded Developer & Custom Sensor Guru*\n* **[Alice Wu](https://github.com/AliceWoooo)** -  *Robotics Software Developer*\n* **[Devidas Lavrik](https://github.com/DLavrik)** - *Lego Builder & PID Expert* \n* **[Finn Zhan Chen](http://finnzhanchen.com/)** - *Business Analyst*\n* **[Mariyana Cholakova](https://github.com/chMariyana)** - *Designer & Admin* \n\n## Contact us\nYou are welcome to visit out [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RoboTour/) or send us an e-mail on robotour.sdp@gmail.com \n\n\n## References\n\n* GitHub.

We are happy to support more devices through contributions for adding other SDKs. \n- Vehicle controls:\n  - Generic keyboard WASD + mouse\n  - Support for Logitech Steering wheel with this open source [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) \n    - Includes force-feedback with the steering wheel.\n    - We used a [Logitech G923 Racing Wheel & Pedals](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)\n      - Full list of supported devices can be found [here](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin/blob/master/README.md) though we can't guarantee out-of-box functionality without testing. \n- Realistic (and parameterizable) rear & side view mirrors \n  - WARNING: very performance intensive\n- Vehicle dashboard:\n  - Speedometer (in miles-per-hour by default)\n  - Gear indicator\n  - Turn signals\n- Dynamic steering wheel\n  - Adjustable parameters, responsive to steering input\n  - See our documentation on this [here](Docs/Model.md)\n- \"Ego-centric\" audio \n  - Responsive engine revving (throttle-based)\n  - Turn signal clicks\n  - Gear switching\n  - Collisions\n- Fully compatible with the existing Carla [PythonAPI](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/python_api/) and [ScenarioRunner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/tree/v0.9.13)\n  - Minor modifications were made. See [Usage.md](Docs/Usage.md) documentation.\n- Fully compatible with the Carla [Recorder and Replayer](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/adv_recorder/) \n  - Including HMD pose/orientation & sensor reenactment \n- Ability to handoff/takeover control to/from Carla's AI wheeled vehicle controller\n- Carla-based semantic segmentation camera (see [`Shaders/README.md`](Shaders/README.md))\n### Ego Sensor\nCarla-compatible **ego-vehicle sensor** (see [EgoSensor.h](DReyeVR/EgoSensor.h)) is an \"invisible sensor\" that tracks the following:\n- Real-time **Eye tracking** with the [HTC Vive Pro Eye](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye-office/) VR headset\n  - Eye tracker data includes:\n    - Timing information (based off headset, world, and eye-tracker)\n    - 3D Eye gaze ray (left, right, & combined)\n    - 2D Pupil position (left & right)\n    - Pupil diameter (left & right)\n    - Eye Openness (left & right)\n    - Focus point in the world & hit actor information\n    - See [DReyeVRData.h:EyeTracker](Carla/Sensor/DReyeVRData.h) for the complete list\n  - Eye reticle visualization in real time\n- Real-time user inputs (throttle, steering, brake, turn signals, etc.)\n- Image (screenshot) frame capture based on the camera \n  - Typically used in Replay rather than real-time because highly performance intensive.\n- Fully compatible with the LibCarla data serialization for streaming to a PythonAPI client (see [LibCarla/Sensor](LibCarla/Sensor))\n  - We have also tested and verified support for (`rospy`) ROS integration our sensor data streams\n\n### Other additions:\n- Custom DReyeVR config file for one-time runtime params. See [DReyeVRConfig.ini](Configs/DReyeVRConfig.ini)\n  - Especially useful to change params without recompiling everything.\n  - Uses standard c++ io management to read the file with minimal performance impact.

Those interested in the Linux discussion for HTC's Vive Pro Eye Tracking can follow the subject [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6994-eye-tracking-in-linux/), [here (Vive)](https://forum.vive.com/topic/7012-vive-pro-eye-on-ubuntu-16-or-18/), and [here (Tobii)](https://developer.tobii.com/community/forums/topic/vive-pro-eye-with-stream-engine/).\n  - Additionally, the [LogitechWheelPlugin](https://github.com/HARPLab/LogitechWheelPlugin) we use only has Windows support currently. Though it should be possible to use the G923 on Linux as per the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Logitech_Racing_Wheel).\n- Also, although MacOS is not officially supported by CARLA, we have development happening on an Apple Silicon machine and have active forks of CARLA + UE4.26 with MacOS 12+ support. Note that this is primarily for development, as it is the most limited system by far. \n\n## Documentation & Guides\n- See [`F.A.Q. wiki`](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for our Frequently Asked Questions wiki page.\n- See [`Install.md`](Docs/Install.md) to install and build DReyeVR\n- See [`Usage.md`](Docs/Usage.md) to learn how to use our provided DReyeVR features\n- See [`Development.md`](Docs/Development.md) to get started with DReyeVR development and add new features\n- See [`Docs/Tutorials/`](Docs/Tutorials/) to view several DReyeVR tutorials such as customizing the EgoVehicle, adding custom signs/props and more.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use our work, please cite the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01931):\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{silvera2022dreyevr,\n  title={DReyeVR: Democratizing Virtual Reality Driving Simulation for Behavioural \\& Interaction Research},\n  author={Silvera, Gustavo and Biswas, Abhijat and Admoni, Henny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages={639--643},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon and extends the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/)\n- This repo includes some code from CARLA: Computer Vision Center (CVC) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) & Intel Corporation.\n- This repo includes some code from Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP.

I wanted to be able to use either a 3 weight yarn or a worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted to use solids and the lovely Mandela/Self-striping yarn.\r\n\r\nI wanted the length to be adjustable, to let the knitter decide whether or not to make the pattern longer.  The pattern does make the length shown, but just keep doing the last repeat to make it longer if you prefer.\r\n\r\nI wanted something the elderly could wear in a wheelchair and not be concerned about it catching in the wheels.  It can also be work by nursing mothers for \"modesty\" reasons.  It would also be lovely for young girls.  And yes, that is all in this one pattern.  Just choose the yarn you want to use and appropriate needle to go with it.\r\n\r\nThis may also be made with a crew neck instead of the rolled ribbed neck.

A blanket doesn't warm the upper body and a sweater bunches uncomfortably at the back of the chair. Someone with limited mobility can't adjust for comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nThis design has a shortened back for warmth but not bulk. It has sleeves to hold the fit and allow for movement.\r\n\r\nThis unisex sweater, is easy to knit, seamless and knit top down with room to adjust front and sleeve lengths. My experience is that full cut sleeves are not as successful for my clients so the pattern has short sleeves that you can adjust.\r\n\r\n *This garment is worked seamlessly from the top-down using the contiguous sleeve method developed by Susie Myers, SusieM on Ravelry (http://www.ravelry.com/people/SusieM).\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_a3709_level0_row4\" class=\"row_heading level0 row4\" >https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cloud-on-her-shoulders</th>\n      <td id=\"T_a3709_row4_col0\" class=\"data row4 col0\" >In exchange for downloading this pattern, please consider making a shawl for a friend or stranger who may find it comforting when recovering from injury, illness or going through chemo therapy. \r\nPreviously this was a for-sale pattern with $1 donation for each sale going to Susan G. Komen foundation, but after hearing many touching stories of the comfort it gave both knitter and receiver, I wanted to open up the potential for giving by making the pattern free. Thanks to all who donated via purchase previously, and thank you to all who might make this pattern as a way to give.\r\n\r\nFeather Light, Cozy Warm, Easy and Portable \r\nPattern revised to include two shapes.\r\nBe sure to try and get close to gauge on this pattern or your shawl will be smaller than you might wish. \r\n\r\nUnless you are a tight knitter, uses about 220 yards\r\n\r\nPeople who have had shoulder injuries, or older folks who are a little frail can be very vulnerable to cold, yet find heavy shoulder coverings uncomfortable. People receiving cancer treatment sometimes feel very chilled, and any extra weight can feel like a burden. This shawl will keep them warm, with almost no added weight. \r\n\r\nThe curved back and neckline means the shawl sits securely on the shoulders, and does not roll or fold uncomfortably against the back when seated. It has the added advantage of being extremely compressible, so it can be smooshed into a small container for travel and will be just as fluffy and warm when it’s taken out for use.\r\n\r\nGreat for using your own handspun yarn, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use a worsted or Aran weight yarn and smaller needles:\r\n\r\n1: skip the first 6 rows, and begin by casting on 17 stitches (otherwise the neck portion will be uncomfortably small) then begin with row 7.  \r\n2: Use the variation for larger framed people\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3: just continue to knit rows 1 and 2 from the second half of the shawl until the knitter feels it is long enough. :-}\r\n\r\nToo long makes it awkward for wheel chair users, so I suggest it be no longer than 13 inches when measured down the spine. Since it will stretch a bit from its own weight, I usually start my bind off when it measures between 12 1/2 to 12 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_a3709_level0_row5\" class=\"row_heading level0 row5\" >https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour</th>\n      <td id=\"T_a3709_row5_col0\" class=\"data row5 col0\" >\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/IMAGES/Logo.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"245\" height=\"170\" align=\"center\" /></p>\n\n\n<h1  align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span  align=\"center\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span align=\"center\" style=\"color: #000000;\"> SDP - GROUP 18 - 2017/18\n</span> </strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nRoboTour is a robotic tour guide that assists people in environments such as museums or art galleries. The system comprises an autonomous robotic guide, a purpose-built Android application, and a web server mediating the communication between the two. Up to two Android devices can control RoboTour and followed by many more. The app allows users to interact with RoboTour intuitively in multiple languages. RoboTour has been designed for minimal maintenance; once the initial setup has been performed. \n\n[RoboTour Promotional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU0O0e72A&feature=youtu.be)\n\n[![Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal](http://img.youtube.com/vi/is1U0O0e72A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hma03HVH12Y \"Directed by Finn, Actors: Alice, Mahbub and Michal\")\n\n### [SDP - 2017/2018 ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\nThe System Design Project is intended to give students practical experience of \n\n(a) building a large scale system \n<br>\n<br>\n(b) working as members of a team. \n\nThe [Systems Design Project ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) is a University of Edinburgh, Semester 2 module, SDP is a group project involving the construction of an item of significant complexity under conditions designed to give insights into industrial teamwork.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a 20 credit course with design, construction and assessment through the semester, ending in a demonstration day with industry visitors.\n<br>\n<br>\nMore detail about the course and how it will run this year are in these slides from the introductory lecture held in semester 1 Professional Issues.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Project\n<br>\n<br>\nSDP 2017/2018's task is to use Lego and an Arduino to design an assistive robotic device, with an appropriate software interface.\n<br>\n<br>\nFlexibility was given to set your own goals for this task, but here is an example of what you could attempt: a person indicates an object on the floor with a laser pointer, and the robot picks it up and returns it to the person.\n<br>\n<br>\nGroups\n<br>\n<br>\nThe class is assigned to groups of 7 or 8, each responsible for the development of a single robot. Assessment involves group marks for the product (performance and documentation of the robot systems).\n<br>\n<br>\nEach group had an assigned mentor, with whom they meet around once a week, and who offers advice and monitors progress, but - importantly - does not lead or manage the group. Advice on how the group should organise themselves for good project management will be provided. Problems within the group should first be brought to the attention of your mentor; if you have an issue with your mentor, you should bring this to the attention of the SDP TA (see below).\n\nThe project involves applying and combining material from several courses to complete a complex design and implementation task. \nAt the end, of course, each group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and visitors from industry (E.g. Google, Amazon, KAL, Robotical).\n\n[DRPS SDP 2017/2018](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm)\n\n\n### [Award - Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts) \nThe project was developed for System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.\nAll 20 projects were assessed by external judges from industry (e.g. Google, Amazon, Accenture, KAL, Sky).\nTeam RoboTour was awarded the [Technical Innovation Prize](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/stories/2018/students-showcase-projects-to-industry-experts)\n\n### [Specifications](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour provides four key features to enhance the user’s experience\n\n* **Multi-language support in Human-Robot Interaction via speech and app** \n* **Guides visitors to a specific art piece and points it out to the user**\n* **Plays audio description of art pieces in the language the user selected** \n* **Provides recommendations and optimal route planning routes**\n\n### [Target Users](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/ProjectPlan.pdf) \nRoboTour assists people who have one of the following problems:\n<br>\n<br>\n•    They’re a museum visitor who needs directional assistance\n<br>\n•    Or they’re a visitor who cannot read the displays in the museum whether this is because they cannot read the language or because they have problems with their vision.\n<br>\n<br>\nRoboTour robot can interact with visitors and guide them to the piece of art they are looking for by moving with the user through the museum and pointing out the art piece upon arrival.\n\n### [Software Structure](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/TechnicalReport.pdf) \nThere are three main components to RoboTour: \n* Android App - Responsible for allowing the user to select paintings they wish to go to and send commands to the robot.\n* Server: All Android devices communicate to the robot via the server. The server is responsible for mediating and storing commands between all Android devices and the robot. The purpose of having the server is to allow multiple android devices to communicate with the robot. \n* Robot: Oversees path planning and navigation around the museum\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/table.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" />\n\n### [The App](https://mahbubiftekhar.co.uk/download.php) \nThe app is backwards compatible with older versions of Android; the app will work with Android SDK version 17 onwards (users also require 20mb free space and an internet connection). The app was developed in Android Studio 3.1 using Kotlin. \n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s1.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s2.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /> <img src=\"/IMAGES/s3.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />   <img src=\"/IMAGES/s4.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"/IMAGES/s5.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s6.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s7.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" /><img src=\"/IMAGES/s8.png\" title=\"RoboTour\" width=\"200\" height=\"390\" />\n\n### [The Robot](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf) \nThe robot is a differential drive platform, i.e. the movement is achieved with two motorised drive wheels. Varying the rotational speed of the wheels independently, allowed us to introduce rotation of the chassis in addition to the linear translation. Additionally, two rear wheels are added for stability and weight support. They were designed with the aim of minimising the friction and disturbance of the robot control.\n\n\n\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/DSC_0943.JPG\" title=\"RoboTour: Start Position\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/Brochure3Rounded.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Mona Lisa\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n <br>\n <img src=\"/IMAGES/robot.png\" title=\"RoboTour: Labelled Diagram\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n\n<br>\n \n\n### [Installing The App](https://github.com/mahbubiftekhar/RoboTour/blob/master/DOCUMENTS/Submissions/UserGuide.pdf)\n<br>\nTo install the app on an Android device, installation, you are required to enable [Unknown Sources](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources).\n<br>\nThis feature is turned off by default on stock Android, and can be turned on by following these steps: \n\nDevice Settings ​-> ​Advanced Settings ​-> ​Security ​->​ Enable Unknown Sources   \n\nOnce the app is downloaded, go to the Downloads folder on your phone and click on the apk or select it from the notifications bar.

    "[section 508 amendent of the rehabiliation act of 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) is drastically insufficient for the needs of interactive computing technology. [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) was published in Dec 2008 long before the demanding needs of modern javascript. compliance actively neglects the needs of assistive technology users in modern learning environments and creates a two-tier system."

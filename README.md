<summary>‚ùì about this repository</summary>

## the `tonyfast` distribution

this repository is one of github's special repositories for my personal profile.
i wanted to do more with than just a readme so i'm using it as a place to package my
computational essays or literate programs as a python distribution. 

currently this project features:

- [x] blogs, essays, notebooks and markdown re-used as python source code
- [x] a python project called `tonyfast` that uses [`hatch`][hatch] for most development tasks (see [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml))

    ```
    pip install -e. # for development mode
    ```

- [x] github actions to deploy my content on github pages. the documentation is made of:

  - [x] [`mkdocs` documentation][notebooks] with my own notebook customizations. (see [`mkdocs.yml`](mkdocs.yml))
  - [x] a no-install, in-the-browser [`jupyterlite` demo][lite] so myself and others can try out the code themselves

- [ ] some things i'd like to do:
  
  - [ ] add cron for some posts
  - [ ] add tests for some posts
  - [ ] build a solid binder to run heavier demos that might not work in `jupyterlite`
